# Multivariate double exponential (Laplace) distribution extension for SciPy
Author: David Salac <https://github.com/david-salac/>

## Description
Generator of the random samples following the Multivariate Double Exponential
(Laplace) Distribution.

Implementation is the extension of the SciPy and follows the same logic as the
generator following the multivariate normal distribution.

## Software User Manual (how to use script)
To generate the samples matrix you need to have a vector of mean values and the
covariance matrix. Samples are generated by the function `pdf` that accepts as
an argument the vector of quantiles (for which you want to generate samples).

Example:
```
from multivariate_laplace import multivariate_laplace

x, y = np.mgrid[-1:1:0.01, -1:1:0.01]
pos = np.empty(x.shape + (2,))
pos[:, :, 0] = x
pos[:, :, 1] = y

mean_values_vector = [0.5, -0.2]
covariance_matrix = [[2.0, 0.3], [0.3, 0.5]]

generator = multivariate_laplace(mean_values_vector, covariance_matrix)
sample_matrix = generator.pdf(pos)
```
_Samples are stored in the variable sample_matrix._ 

### Run the script
If you want to run the demo script you need to satisfy the requirements that
are enumerated in the file `requirements_demo.txt`. You can install them
directly using PIP:
```
pip install -r requirements_demo.txt
```

### Default requirements
Sufficient requirements for running the multivariate Laplace distribution
script are in the file `requirements.txt` and can be installed via PIP:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
